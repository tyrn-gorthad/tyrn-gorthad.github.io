### Tyrn Gorthad
Obyvatelé Tyrn Gorthadu si udrželi něco ze vznešenosti Dúnadanůa jejich vzhled je proto mnohem upravenější, než skřetí. Nechodí v jiné barvě, než černé, a jejich oděvy často zdobí starobylé runy a symboly. Při svých temných rituálech si také roztírají po pažích i obličejích krev svých obětí.
“Pozn. autora: Vzhledem k tomu, že je Tyrn Gorthad velmi settingově specifický, a je na B5A uveden poprvé, zaměříme se v inspiromatu na požadované kostýmové prvky zvlášť. Modelového vojáka od hlavy k patě bohužel nemáme k dispozici.I proto byste měli kostýmu věnovat úsilí a pak otravovat fotografy, aby vás cvakli –nenechte si ujít příležitost objevit se v inspiromatu na příští rok!

SYMBOLY, WARPAINT

Tyrn Gorthaďané jsou především kultisté. Uctívání mohylových duchů je jejich hlavní životní náplní. Proto použití temných symbolů a krvavého warpaintu považujeme za velice důležité.
Nezapomínejte, že barva warpaintu by měla co nejvěrněji připomínat krev, ale nezapomeňte ani na vznešený původ – v mysli si vyvolejte spíš potřísněného okultistu vrouchu, než šamana z pralesa. Paint můžete doplnit runami jiné barvy.

Ozdobit runami můžete i svůj oděv – taková kápě je na to ideální. V našem případě bude samozřejmě černá. Použít můžete elfský tengwar, nebo třeba fanouškovské zpracování dávného písma Númenorejců.

ČERNÁ BARVA
Použití černé barvyje dalším specifikem tohoto rodu.Můžete být upravenější, nebo ošumělejší, stejně jako vkaždéjiné armádě. Zachovejte však civilizovanější vzhled. Jste vyššího rodu, než upadající, divocí vrchovci.Hadráky máme rádi! Nezapomeňte, že dlouhý plášť není do bitvy příliš praktický, volte spíše kápě.

Lehké zbroje jsou taky fajn!

![](/img/origin_inspiro2.png)

No, a kdo se necítí dobře bez pořádné kovové zbroje...(Nezapomínejte si místo ryby Tullyů přimyslet třeba pokřivenou, znesvěcenou hvězdu Arnoru)

![](/img/origin_inspiroa.png)

Nebo je libo něco složitějšího? Inspirujte se high fantasy, jen mějte na mysli, že stále preferujeme přírodní materiály a zbroje byste měl mít funkční.

 From TurnerMohans Deviantart collection:
 
* a soldier from the numenorean "golden age," ranging from about SA. 1000 to SA. 2000. I've done several takes on numenorean armor already, but most of them were supposed to be styles of the rather more conquistador-like late-second-age dunedain, and I thought it'd be fun to go back in time and try and make some designs that could have evolved into those later models (i'd love to make one of those huge, victorian-style "historic costume in pictures" books for middle earth, consisting of hundreds of plates tracking the evolution of dress and armament for all the different races and cultures, over the thousands of years of history, sadly I'll mos likely only have one lifetime, and will therefore end up restricting such a project to a few one offs like this one)

I see this as a sort of numenorean "hellenistic period" following numenorean Antiquity (from the reign of Elros Tar-minyatur and going until Tar-Aldarion) and preceding the Imperial phase (beginning with the reign of Tar-Ancalimon and ending, famously, with Ar-Pharazon's disastrous invasion of Valinor); a period characterized by numenor's rise as the great seapower, by increased interaction (benign at first) with the people of middle-earth, and the establishing of coastal cities in middle-earth. I went with a more or less greek hoplite/alexandrian-style cuirasse of scales and hardened linen, only the harness is much longer than the greek kind, trailing off into these long skirts of scale, which seems appropriate for both the great height of the numenoreans and their rather atlantian aesthetic. His Karma is quite a bit closer to tolkien's original design than some of my other designs; I was thinking that at this stage numenor was not the crushing military presence that it later became, and so their armor at this time is more artistic and less concerned with remaining perfectly streamlined than the later models (like the difference between those beautiful, iconic greek korinthian helmets and the comparatively bland utilitarian roman "gallic" helmets)

i'm rather proud of that sword, I was trying to make it look like a greek xiphos, roman gladius and viking longsword all at once. It's always been a particularly damning question to me - given that the numenoreans, who practically cry out for a greco/roman bent to their style, are the descendents of the very northern european, dark-age seeming edain - how do you make fashion evolve from beowulfian mail and longswords into a more mediterranian look?*

*"Nonetheless for long it seemed to the Númenóreans that they prospered, and if they were not increased in happiness, yet they grew more strong, and their rich men ever richer… And they sailed now with power and armoury to Middle-earth, and came no longer as bringers of gifts, nor even as rulers, but as fierce men of war. And they hunted the men of Middle-earth and took their goods and enslaved them, and many they slew cruelly upon their altars. For they built in their fortresses temples and great tombs in those days; and men feared them, and the memory of the kindly kings of the ancient days faded from the world and was darkened by many a tale of dread."

--The Silmarillion, "Akallabeth: the Downfall of Numenor"

Following from my design for the armor of the numenoreans in their earlier, brighter days, here we have the numenorean soldier as he likely would have appeared in the last few hundred years of the history of Westerness, starting around the reign of Ar-Adunakhor the self-proclaimed "Lord of the West" and ending with the Drowning, a period mainly characterized by the changing of Numenor from a peaceful society to an ever expanding empire and colonial presence in middle-earth. The White Tree, the old sigil of the Kings and a symbol of the friendship of the dunedain with the elves and the Powers in the West, has been replaced with the face of Earendil, winged and elevated to godlike stature by the last few generations of numenoreans - like most enduring mythic/historical figures, I imagine the context of Earendil's life and achievements is readily mutable to serve the political/social climate of the time: as the kings of Numenor grow ever more powerful and become more arrogant and hostile to the Valar, Earendil the human hero who reached the West against their ban and obtained eternal life is remembered, while Earendil the half-elf and messenger to the Valar is generally forgotten or ignored - it seems a dependable trait of proud civilizations on the verge of self-destruction that in their pride and vanity they elevate Man to the level of the gods, and if the book of Exodus or the 'Clash of the Titans' movies are indicator, it usually doesn't end well. The sword at his side, an heirloom probably many generations old (as I would expect many swords of the Dunedain to be) still bears the tree.

The dagger is a numenorean eket, a short sword described as about a 1'-18" in length (I expect the numenorean barrow blades the hobbits acquire, with their scarlet and gold hilts, are ekets) imagined here as something closer to a roman pugio than a seax-knife. The leopard skin is a trophy likely acquired during some campaign in the Harad lands. I think of the numenoreans as having a fearsome, predatory aspect about them at this time; that as their civilization has become more advanced and powerful they have actually become more violent and barbaric. These are a people who would build arenas to watch men fight to the death in.

overall I'm quite happy with this design, it hits the "late antiquity" notes I'd hoped for while avoiding the too-familiar look of the roman loricas (or worse still, the muscle cuirass) Rome is the obvious basis for Numenor (and her comparatively humble, byzantine descendants in Gondor and Arnor) but it's 'Rome' through a foreign lens, a Saxon (and decidedly Christian) lens, one though which the general outlines of an ancient, great, powerful, wise, proud, sinful, ultimately doomed civilization are visible, while many of the specific (and specifically Mediterranean) aspects of historical Rome are lost, washed out, or made more readily applicable to the cultural expectations of a more "northern" audience.*

![](/img/numenorean_helmets_by_turnermohan_d6anxsd-pre.jpg)

*Several attempts at the Numenorean "Karma," a type of seafarer's helmet referenced only once in Tolkien's entire legendarium, as an explanation for this rather bizarre looking drawing of his, which appeared on the original cover of Unifinished Tales [link] (you've gotta love Tolkien for stuff like this; just when all the Bayeux tapestry-style long mail shirts and conical iron caps are in danger of getting monotonous, he'll throw a big psychedelic snail-looking thingie in the mix, just to shake things up)
trying to find some historical influences which felt fitting for a more realistic version of tolkien's illustration, I ended up drawing primarily from the classical greek corinthian, the macedonian helmets of alexander's armies, and the renaissance era burgonets, with a healthy dose of the good old roman/gallic helmets, among others. It seems appropriate, for illustrating the numenoreans, to draw (in addition to armor sources from antiquity) from a later, more advanced period in the history armor making than is generally seen in the other cultures of middle earth. despite their hubris (which ofcourse lead to their downfall) the numenoreans were indeed a superior people. I really liked the idea that that bulbous, octopus-like bulge in the back (especially on the archaic model, when worn back on the head like a greek hoplite) would give the wearer this elongated, alien like silhouette which, combined with the great stature of the dunedain (in their hey day they're supposed to have averaged at about seven feet) and their might and splendor, would indeed give the comparatively primitive men of middle earth the impression of alien, even godlike beings (basically the Middle-Earth explanation for those prometheus-esq pop science theories about tall alien (or, often enough and fittingly, Atlantean) teachers coming to earth in the ancient past; one could imagine rough, mythologized likenesses of numenoreans painted by primitives onto cave walls, or carved on standing stones)
I don't think of the Karma as one specific type of helmet per se, but rather, like real historical helmet designs such as the basinet or spangenhelm, as a particular (and evolving) 'school' of helmet construction, consisting of many different designs but charactorized by a few consistent features, nor was it by any means the only style of helmet made in Numenor. I think of them as having been a phenomenally rich culture aesthetically, much of which was lost forever in the drowning, and of the majesty of which only a small part (and perhaps not even the better part) survived and continued in the realms of Gondor and Arnor.*

![](/img/numenorean_armor_2_color_by_turnermohan_d7fmpus-pre.jpg)

*And here we have a sample of the later, imperial-era numenorean armament, following from my concept for numeorean "golden age" armor, Whereas that piece was more late-classical greek in inspiration, for this one I wanted to incorporate many of the same elements, but evolved into a more advanced, streamlined and regimented look, like the roman loricas, and incorporating more naked steel. a long while back, I'd done a quick sketch of Numenorean plate armor (which sadly has dissapeared) that was basically a full plate harness, sculpted like the finest gothic suits, but with this aquatic, atlantian bent to it, all spirals and fin shapes: I tried to incorporate much of that (or as much of it as I could remember) into this one while keeping it an only partial plate harness (tolkien doesnt really seem to favor plate armor)

The greek-style cuirasse we see in the golden age armor has carried over to this one, but the scale sides have been replaced by chainmail, and the hard-woven linen front and back by sculpted steel. The shins, elbows and upper arms are now armored, and the shoes and cloak heavier, as an adjustment to more serious campaigns in middle-earth. the scale skirt has remained constant.

I'm quite pleased with this late-period karma as more sleek and functional than it's more decorative predescessor, while still striking a weirdly elegant, cephalopod-like profile (moreso that the earlier one actually, i think). I dont think all the design elements work with eachother; Those greek/roman style shoulder guards were carried over from the hellenistic "golden age" design, but looking at it now I think I should have gone for more sculpted, 'naked steel' pauldrons (which were my initial impulse, and would have fit better with the the overall harness I think)

and that's a leopard skin tied around his shoulders, a popular item among legionnaires in Harad.*

![](/img/ar_pharazon_by_turnermohan_d6e3zme-pre.jpg)

*Ar-Pharazon the Golden, the twenty fifth and last King of Numenor. He defeated and captured Sauron, only to end up corrupted and tricked by him into worshipping Morgoth and declaring war on the Valar, resulting in the drowning of Numenor and the death of the great majority of it's people.

I always envisioned Ar-pharazon (like Boromir) as very much a Henry VIII-type character, specifically Henry in his prime when he was known as "the handsomest of the Princes of Europe," (before aging into the bloated figure from the Holbein portraits) a big, broad shouldered man, a powerful athlete and fearless military commander, charismatic, loved by the people, but also proud, selfish, power-hungry and (as it happened) easily manipulated by evil.

We see him here at his great moment of triumph, after the capture of sauron; parading through the streets of Armenelos on his huge war horse, behind him his armies and legions, bearers of gold and trinkets from the south, huge exotic beasts, and at the center of it all, the real life, honest-to-god Lord of Mordor himself, chained and displayed (recalling the chaining of melkor) atop a parade float decorated with bronze images of numenorean soldiers spearing demonic creatures underfoot (THAT will definitely be getting a drawing some time soon) I spent a long time debating what 'kind' of armor to put him in before settling, somewhat reluctantly on plate armor, it just seemed such a good fit for the majesty, pomp, and sort-of gunslinger's swagger of the character (middle earth's warriors are near-universally clad in chainmail, but I like to think (or rather to rationalize) that the numenoreans of all men, renowned for their advanced craft, may have been into some experimentation with plate, and the Golden King, of all men, would take one look at the glorious new innovation and have to have it)

Designing the heraldry of the late 2nd age numenoreans was something of a challenge, as it seems those symbols of theirs which we see surviving in gondor ("seven stars and seven stones, and one white tree") represent the old friendship of numenor with the elves and the powers in the west, most likely unfashionable at the time of Ar-pharazon's reign. I thought perhaps more emphasis would be placed on the figure of Earendil himself and/or his son Elros Tar-minyatur, elevating the man (and by extension his descendants) to near divine status. Also I very much like the idea of the late Numenoreans adopting styles and design motifs from conquered lands, resulting in a prevalence of perverse, chimeral beasts from Haradric or Khandian tradition (manticores, gryphons , etc.) appearing in the last days of numenorean art history (I imagine that the lion, a creature unmentioned in the northwest of middle earth but one that we may assume existed in the far regions to the south and east, would be a favorite among the kingsmen; regal and predatory, perhaps the faces of Ar-pharazon and others appeared on sphinxes)*
