The Barrow-downs or Tyrn Gorthad were a series of low hills east of the Shire, behind the Old Forest, and southwest of the village of Bree. Many of the hills were crowned with megaliths and barrows, hence their name.

				Mohylové vrchy zvané také Tyrn Gorthad jsou kopcovitá oblast na východ od Kraje a Starého Hvozdu, jihozápadně of vesnice Hůrky. Věrné svému jméu mnoho kopců je zde korunováno obelisky a mohylami.

The Barrow-downs were first inhabited by Men related to the Edain in the First Age, together with the Hills of Evendim to the north. They fled east as Easterlings invaded Eriador and passed on to Beleriand, but after these had left or been killed in the War of Wrath the Edain returned to their old homes.

Vrchy byly prvně osídleny muži spřízněnými s Edainy v Prvním Věku, společně s kopci Evendimu na severu. Ti ustoupili na jih východ když Východňané vpadli do Eriadoru a na západ do Beleriandu. Když však odešli nebo byli zabiti ve Válce Hněvu Edain se vrátili do svého bývalého domova.

During the Second Age they were fairly numerous, and when they met with the Númenóreans the Barrow-downs were the first places where the Dúnedain émigrés from Númenor settled. When Elendil returned to Middle-earth, the Barrow-downs were incorporated into the kingdom of Arnor. The Downs were revered because of the Great Barrows by the Arnorians, and buried their lords and Kings there.



After the split of Arnor in T.A. 861 the Barrow-downs became the capital of Cardolan. After Rhudaur fell to Angmar in 1409, the Dúnedain of Cardolan entrenched themselves here, but eventually the realm fell. Around T.A. 1636 the Witch-king sent the Barrow-wights that haunted the hills, preventing any resettlement; after Arthedain once again claimed the kingship over all of Arnor the Dúnedain tried to recolonize Cardolan, but this failed because of the Barrow-wights.

When the Black Riders came north in their hunt for the One Ring, the Lord of the Nazgûl stayed in the Barrow-downs for a few days, rousing the Barrow-wights. On 28 September 3018 Frodo Baggins and company were trapped in the downs by a wight, probably in the same cairn which held the grave of the last prince of Cardolan. They were rescued by Tom Bombadil, and there got their swords.
